"""Tools for Early Congestion and Timing Evaluator.

Each function below is the stable operation contract for this agent. A framework
adapter (Yosys, OpenROAD, OpenSTA, or a licensed tool) is responsible for actually
performing the EDA work. Until a framework is bound through ``EDA_FRAMEWORK`` /
backend.type, every call returns a structured observation with status ``not_run``
and must not invoke a synthesizer, placer, router, equivalence engine, or simulator.

EDA focus for this tool module: Pre-detail estimates of routability and timing via trial global placement and global route (OpenROAD). Identifies congestion hotspots and critical interfaces. Numbers are estimates, not signoff STA or detailed routing.

Common return shape:
    ``tool_observation(name, payload, agent_id="early_congestion_timing")`` builds the dict the
    fleet journals and the planner consumes. Side effects are limited to that
    observation record unless an adapter is bound.

Failures:
    Adapters may raise or return failed statuses when required scripts, libraries,
    constraints, or DEFs are missing; the unbound path should not raise merely
    because no engine exists.
