"""Tools for IR/EM Agent.

Each function below is the stable operation contract for IR drop and electromigration (EM) on the power grid. A framework
adapter performs the real work (OpenROAD, OpenSTA, licensed DRC/LVS/IR/thermal/power
tools, or simulators) when ``EDA_FRAMEWORK`` is bound.

Until a framework is bound, every call returns status ``not_run`` and does **not** invoke
OpenROAD, Yosys, OpenSTA, a licensed tool, or a simulator. That keep-safe behavior lets
the fleet exercise planning, journaling, and telemetry without mutating silicon artifacts.

EDA focus for this module: static/dynamic IR maps, EM current density, grid and placement repair.
Observations always stamp ``agent_id='ir_em'`` so signoff_validator and leads can audit
which worker claimed a check.
