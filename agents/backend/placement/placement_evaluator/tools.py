"""Tools for the Independent Multi-Corner Placement Evaluator.

Independent multi-corner / multi-mode placement evaluation rejects apparent gains that only shift timing or density violations to another PVT corner. Emits placement gates and provenance records.

Each function below is the stable operation contract the lead/workflow invokes.
A framework adapter (for example OpenROAD) is responsible for performing the
physical-design action. Until a framework is bound, every callable returns an
observation with status ``not_run`` via ``tool_observation`` and does **not**
invoke OpenROAD, Yosys, OpenSTA, a licensed vendor tool, or a simulator.

Importing this module only registers ``@tool`` metadata for the agent SDK; it
does not open the design database. Side effects begin when the HTTP agent
service dispatches a skill listed in ``config.yaml`` to one of these callables.
