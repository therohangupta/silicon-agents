"""Placement Experiment Worker.

Runs one isolated placement strategy: global placement, detailed placement, mirroring, legalization, buffering/sizing, and timing repair under OpenROAD, without promoting onto the canonical baseline.

This module defines the thin agent class that the HTTP service in ``server.py``
instantiates. Behavior (memory, context assembly, tool dispatch, journaling) is
inherited from ``domains.eda.agent.EdaAgent``. The only local responsibility is
to bind ``spec`` by reading ``config.yaml`` from this directory so role, stage,
boundaries, skills, and connection port (8244) are authoritative.

Side effects of importing this module are limited to class definition and a
one-time ``read_spec`` call when the class body executes. No EDA tool runs
until ``EdaAgent.handle`` / tool callables in ``tools.py`` are invoked.

    """Concrete fleet agent for: Run one placement/legalization/buffering/sizing strategy in an isolated workspace (OpenROAD).

    Purpose:
        Register this agent's ``AgentSpec`` and inherit task handling from ``EdaAgent``.

    Attributes:
        spec: Loaded from sibling ``config.yaml`` (role=worker, stage=placement,
            HTTP port=8244). Skills listed there map to callables in ``tools.py``.

    Side effects:
        Class-body evaluation calls ``EdaAgent.read_spec``, which parses YAML and may
        raise if the spec is missing or invalid. No network listen occurs here.

    Failures:
        ``TypeError`` later in ``EdaAgent.__init__`` if ``spec`` is not an ``AgentSpec``.
        Spec load errors propagate from the registry/YAML loader.
