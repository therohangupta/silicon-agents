"""SI/Noise Repair Agent.

Signal integrity (SI) covers crosstalk, coupling capacitance, and glitches on victim nets attacked by aggressors. Repairs include spacing, shielding, and layer changes, then re-verify noise and timing impact.

This module defines the thin agent class that the HTTP service in ``server.py``
instantiates. Behavior (memory, context assembly, tool dispatch, journaling) is
inherited from ``domains.eda.runtime.EDAAgent``. The only local responsibility is
to bind ``eda_config`` by reading ``config.yaml`` from this directory so role, stage,
boundaries, skills, and connection port (8252) are authoritative.

Side effects of importing this module are limited to class definition and a
one-time ``EDAAgent.load_config`` call when the class body executes. No EDA tool runs
until ``EDAAgent.handle`` / tool callables in ``tools.py`` are invoked.

    Purpose:
        Register this agent's ``EDAAgentConfig`` and inherit task handling from ``EDAAgent``.

    Attributes:
        spec: Loaded from sibling ``config.yaml`` (role=worker, stage=routing,
            HTTP port=8252). Skills listed there map to callables in ``tools.py``.

    Side effects:
        Class-body evaluation calls ``EDAAgent.load_config``, which parses YAML and may
        raise if the spec is missing or invalid. No network listen occurs here.

    Failures:
        ``TypeError`` later in ``EDAAgent.__init__`` if ``eda_config`` is not an ``EDAAgentConfig``.
        Spec load errors propagate from the registry/YAML loader.
