"""Tools for the Cross-Partition Boundary Coordinator.

When a chip is partitioned, abutting blocks must agree on pins, feedthroughs, routing channels, power straps, clock handoff, and timing budgets. This coordinator checks consistency without editing either placement's canonical database.

Each function below is the stable operation contract the lead/workflow invokes.
A framework adapter (for example OpenROAD) is responsible for performing the
physical-design action. Until a framework is bound, every callable returns an
observation with status ``not_run`` via ``tool_observation`` and does **not**
invoke OpenROAD, Yosys, OpenSTA, a licensed vendor tool, or a simulator.

Importing this module only registers ``@tool`` metadata for the agent SDK; it
does not open the design database. Side effects begin when the HTTP agent
service dispatches a skill listed in ``config.yaml`` to one of these callables.
