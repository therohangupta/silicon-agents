"""Placement Lead.

Standard-cell placement positions instances inside a partition after floorplan. The lead coordinates timing, congestion, power, and legalization across experiment workers and evaluators, then recommends which placement candidate proceeds.

This module defines the thin agent class that the HTTP service in ``server.py``
instantiates. Behavior (memory, context assembly, tool dispatch, journaling) is
inherited from ``domains.eda.runtime.EDAAgent``. The only local responsibility is
to bind ``eda_config`` by reading ``config.yaml`` from this directory so role, stage,
boundaries, skills, and connection port (8243) are authoritative.

Side effects of importing this module are limited to class definition and a
one-time ``EDAAgent.load_config`` call when the class body executes. No EDA tool runs
until ``EDAAgent.handle`` / tool callables in ``tools.py`` are invoked.

    Purpose:
        Register this agent's ``EDAAgentConfig`` and inherit task handling from ``EDAAgent``.

    Attributes:
        spec: Loaded from sibling ``config.yaml`` (role=lead, stage=placement,
            HTTP port=8243). Skills listed there map to callables in ``tools.py``.

    Side effects:
        Class-body evaluation calls ``EDAAgent.load_config``, which parses YAML and may
        raise if the spec is missing or invalid. No network listen occurs here.

    Failures:
        ``TypeError`` later in ``EDAAgent.__init__`` if ``eda_config`` is not an ``EDAAgentConfig``.
        Spec load errors propagate from the registry/YAML loader.
