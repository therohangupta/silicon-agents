"""Tools for Equivalence.

Each function below is the stable operation contract for this agent. A framework
adapter (Yosys, OpenROAD, OpenSTA, or a licensed tool) is responsible for actually
performing the EDA work. Until a framework is bound through ``EDA_FRAMEWORK`` /
backend.type, every call returns a structured observation with status ``not_run``
and must not invoke a synthesizer, placer, router, equivalence engine, or simulator.

EDA focus for this tool module: Logical (combinational) and sequential equivalence checking (LEC/SEC) between RTL and a transformed netlist. Compare-point maps, black boxes, and setup/constraints must be justified; mapped-away points without justification are findings. This is a check that feeds synthesis_lead, not an independent tapeout gate.

Common return shape:
    ``tool_observation(name, payload, agent_id="equivalence")`` builds the dict the
    fleet journals and the planner consumes. Side effects are limited to that
    observation record unless an adapter is bound.

Failures:
    Adapters may raise or return failed statuses when required scripts, libraries,
    constraints, or DEFs are missing; the unbound path should not raise merely
    because no engine exists.

        Publish a compare point removed from the map without architectural justification.

    Args:
        summary: One-sentence finding written into engineering memory for downstream agents.
        evidence_refs: Comma-separated artifact URIs that substantiate the finding or tradeoff.
        severity: Finding severity: low, medium, high, or critical relative to hard requirements.
        recommended_recipient: Agent id that should act next on this finding.
        params: Optional dict of extra adapter knobs merged into the observation payload.

    Returns:
        dict observation from ``tool_observation`` describing the requested
        `flag_mapped_away_point` operation for agent `equivalence`. When no EDA framework is
        bound, status is ``not_run`` and no netlist/DEF/SDC file is mutated.

    Side effects:
        Journals an observation through the shared helper. A bound adapter may
        additionally write scripts, netlists, SDC, DEF, or report artifacts.

    Failures:
        Bound adapters fail when required RTL, libraries, constraints, or physical
        inputs are missing or inconsistent; the unbound path returns ``not_run``.
