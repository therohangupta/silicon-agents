"""Tools for Requirements Agent (`requirements`).

Each function is the stable operation contract for one advertised capability in config.yaml.
A framework adapter (OpenROAD, commercial CDC/lint/UPF, simulator, etc.) performs the real
work when `EDA_FRAMEWORK` is bound. Until then, every call returns status `not_run` via
`tool_observation` and does **not** invoke OpenROAD, Yosys, OpenSTA, a licensed tool, or a
simulator.

This agent serves the **architecture** stage of frontend chip design.
Product goals become traceable, measurable requirements with acceptance criteria. Untestable or conflicting requirements are flagged before RTL freezes ambiguous behavior.

Callers (LLM runtime or orchestrator) pass string refs and optional `params`. Payloads are
assembled explicitly so telemetry and adapters see a stable schema per skill id.
