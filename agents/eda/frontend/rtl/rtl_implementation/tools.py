"""Tools for RTL Implementation Agent (`rtl_implementation`).

Each function is the stable operation contract for one advertised capability in config.yaml.
A framework adapter (OpenROAD, commercial CDC/lint/UPF, simulator, etc.) performs the real
work when `EDA_FRAMEWORK` is bound. Until then, every call returns status `not_run` via
`tool_observation` and does **not** invoke OpenROAD, Yosys, OpenSTA, a licensed tool, or a
simulator.

This agent serves the **rtl** stage of frontend chip design.
RTL implementation makes one bounded source edit per candidate branch with an explicit hypothesis. Isolated branches keep the canonical baseline immutable until a lead promotes a qualified candidate.

Callers (LLM runtime or orchestrator) pass string refs and optional `params`. Payloads are
assembled explicitly so telemetry and adapters see a stable schema per skill id.
