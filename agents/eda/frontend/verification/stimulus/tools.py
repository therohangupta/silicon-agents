"""Tools for the stimulus agent in the EDA chip-design agent fleet.

Operation contracts for the stimulus verification specialist.

This module is the stable operation contract for the stimulus specialist that writes directed and constrained-random tests aimed at coverage holes. Each ``@tool``
function is a skill the LLM or orchestrator may invoke. Bodies do not call a
simulator, formal engine, or OpenROAD directly: they assemble a typed payload
and return ``tool_observation(...)``. Until a framework adapter is bound,
observations typically surface status ``not_run`` and never invoke OpenROAD,
Yosys, OpenSTA, a licensed EDA tool, or a UVM simulator. Skill names must stay
aligned with this agent's ``config.yaml`` capabilities and skills lists.
"""

from __future__ import annotations  # Allow dict | None annotations without runtime evaluation cost.

from packages.agent_sdk import tool  # Registers each callable as a discoverable agent skill.
from domains.eda.adapters import tool_observation  # Builds the standard observation dict (status, payload, agent_id).

    Purpose:
        For the stimulus specialist that writes directed and constrained-random tests aimed at coverage holes: Publish a constraint that removes a previously failing legal transaction.
        Invoking ``flag_failure_avoiding_constraint`` records the intended verification operation for agent ``stimulus``.
        A bound framework adapter performs the real EDA work; this process only builds the observation.

    Arguments:
        summary: One-sentence finding or record for engineering memory.

        severity: Finding severity: low, medium, high, or critical.

    Side effects:

    Failure behavior:

        invoke simulators, formal engines, OpenROAD, Yosys, or OpenSTA. Empty fields are still
        forwarded so the adapter can reject them explicitly.
