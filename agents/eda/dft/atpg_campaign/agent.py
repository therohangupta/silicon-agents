"""ATPG Campaign agent class (atpg_campaign).

Runs Automatic Test Pattern Generation across required fault models (stuck-at, transition, path-delay, IDDQ). Tracks coverage, pattern count, tester time, and shift/capture power against the DFT contract.

This module defines the concrete ``AtpgCampaignAgent`` subclass of ``EDAAgent``.
The class does not implement tool bodies itself: runtime behavior comes from
``tools.py`` (skill callables) and ``config.yaml`` (fleet metadata, boundaries,
delegation graph, ports, and context policy). ``EDAAgent.load_config`` loads that
YAML from this directory when the class body evaluates ``eda_config = ...``.

In the dft track, planners open tasks against this agent via the HTTP
service in ``server.py``. Until an EDA or lab framework adapter is bound,
tools return structured ``not_run`` observations rather than driving ATPG,
scan insertion, MBIST, or bench instruments.

Original short description preserved for continuity: ATPG Campaign Agent.

from pathlib import Path  # Locate this agent's directory for config.yaml / tools.py adjacency.

from domains.eda.runtime import EDAAgent  # Shared chip-design agent base (memory, context, act).


class AtpgCampaignAgent(EDAAgent):
    """ATPG Campaign specialist bound to this directory's fleet manifest.

    Purpose:
        Provide a typed ``EDAAgent`` subclass whose ``eda_config`` is the YAML in this
        folder so the fleet server and gateway can discover ports, skills, and
        boundaries for atpg_campaign.

    Behavior:
        Inherits ``handle`` / ``act`` from ``EDAAgent``. Skill execution resolves
        callables listed under ``skills`` in ``config.yaml`` to functions in
        ``tools.py``. No local methods override that path.

    Side effects:
        Class attribute ``eda_config`` is loaded at import time by reading
        ``config.yaml`` next to this file. A missing or invalid YAML raises
        during import.

    Failure:
        If ``EDAAgent.load_config`` cannot parse the directory, importing ``agent`` fails
        and ``server.py`` cannot start the HTTP process.
