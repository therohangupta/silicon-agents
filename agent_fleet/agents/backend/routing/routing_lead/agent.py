"""Routing Lead.

Global and detailed routing closure. Coordinates congestion relief, timing-driven route choices, signal-integrity (SI) noise repair, antenna fixes, and manufacturability checks before any routed candidate advances.

This module defines the thin agent class that the HTTP service in ``server.py``
instantiates. Behavior (memory, context assembly, tool dispatch, journaling) is
inherited from ``domains.eda.agent.EdaAgent``. The only local responsibility is
to bind ``spec`` by reading ``config.yaml`` from this directory so role, stage,
boundaries, skills, and connection port (8249) are authoritative.

Side effects of importing this module are limited to class definition and a
one-time ``read_spec`` call when the class body executes. No EDA tool runs
until ``EdaAgent.handle`` / tool callables in ``tools.py`` are invoked.

    Purpose:
        Register this agent's ``AgentSpec`` and inherit task handling from ``EdaAgent``.

    Attributes:
        spec: Loaded from sibling ``config.yaml`` (role=lead, stage=routing,
            HTTP port=8249). Skills listed there map to callables in ``tools.py``.

    Side effects:
        Class-body evaluation calls ``EdaAgent.read_spec``, which parses YAML and may
        raise if the spec is missing or invalid. No network listen occurs here.

    Failures:
        ``TypeError`` later in ``EdaAgent.__init__`` if ``spec`` is not an ``AgentSpec``.
        Spec load errors propagate from the registry/YAML loader.
