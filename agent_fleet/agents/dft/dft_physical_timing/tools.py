"""Tool callables for the DFT Physical/Timing agent (dft_physical_timing).

Hands scan order and test-mode timing/power into physical design.

Each function below is the stable operation contract advertised in
``config.yaml`` under ``skills``. A framework adapter (DFT tool, ATPG engine,
MBIST compiler, lab instrument bridge, ATE, etc.) performs the real work.
Until that adapter is bound, ``tool_observation`` returns a structured
``not_run`` result and does **not** invoke OpenROAD, Yosys, OpenSTA, a licensed
DFT/ATE tool, a simulator, or a physical instrument.

This module is imported when a skill is dispatched. Process bootstrap lives in
``server.py``; fleet metadata and param schemas live in ``config.yaml``.
